There are only 3 files necessary to have the data tables: 
jquery.js datatables.min.css, and datatables.min.js


For the datatables files:
Step1: go here: https://datatables.net/download/
Step2: navigate to download
Step3: select packages -- I have done (Step1: DataTables; Step2: DataTable, jQuery 3; Step3:Responsive)
Step4: copy cdn to header of html page

In my table_cdn page I have also imported a jQuery cdn from jQuery releases.
However, you don't need to if you include jquery in step2 of the datatables.net/download/.
If you make different selections you can see the two urls for the cdns change 
just a little bit to include jquery or any other options you select.



There could be other ways to do this but I haven't checked
